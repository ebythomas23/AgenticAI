       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'speech.txt'}, page_content='The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\\n\\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\\n\\n…\\n\\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us—however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.\\n\\nWe have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship—exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\\n\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.\\n\\nTo such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.')]"

Directional circulation is achieved with con-\\ntrolled phase-sensitive interference of six distinct\\nelectro-mechanical signal conversion paths. The\\npresented circulator is compact, its silicon-on-\\ninsulator platform is compatible with both su-\\nperconducting qubits [8] and silicon photonics,\\nand its noise performance is close to the quan-\\ntum limit.\\nWith a high dynamic range, a tun-\\nable bandwidth of up to 30 MHz and an in-situ\\nreconﬁgurability as beam splitter or wavelength\\nconverter [9, 10], it could pave the way for su-\\nperconducting qubit processors with multiplexed\\non-chip signal processing and readout.\\nNonreciprocal devices are quintessential tools to sup-\\npress spurious modes, interferences and unwanted signal\\npaths. More generally, circulators can be used to realize\\nchiral networks [11] in systems where directional matter-\\nlight coupling is not easily accessible. In circuit quantum\\nelectrodynamics circulators are used for single port cou-\\npling or as isolators to protect the vulnerable cavity and\\nqubit states from electromagnetic noise. State of the art\\npassive microwave circulators are based on magneto-optic\\neﬀects which require sizable magnetic ﬁelds incompati-\\nble with ultra-low loss superconducting circuits forming\\na major roadblock towards a fully integrated quantum\\nprocessor based on superconducting qubits.\\nMany recent theoretical and experimental eﬀorts have\\nbeen devoted to overcome these limitations both in the\\noptical [12–14] and microwave regimes [2–5, 15–18]. In\\nparallel, the rapidly growing ﬁeld of optomechanical and\\nelectromechanical systems has shown promising potential\\nfor applications in quantum information processing and\\ncommunication, in particular for microwave to optical\\n∗shabir.barzanjeh@ist.ac.at\\n† jﬁnk@ist.ac.at\\nconversion [19, 20] and ampliﬁcation [21]. Very recently,\\nseveral theoretical proposals [6, 22, 23] have pointed out\\nthat optomechanical systems can lead to nonreciprocity\\nand ﬁrst isolators have just been demonstrated in the\\noptical domain [24–26]. Here, we present an on-chip mi-\\ncrowave circulator using a new and tunable silicon elec-\\ntromechanical system.\\nThe main elements of the microchip circulator device\\nare shown in Fig. 1 a-b.\\nThe circuit is comprised of\\nthree high-impedance spiral inductors (Li) capacitively\\ncoupled to the in-plane vibrational modes of a dielectric\\nnanostring mechanical resonator. The nanostring oscilla-\\ntor consists of two thin silicon beams that are connected\\nby two symmetric tethers and fabricated from a high re-\\nsistivity silicon-on-insulator device layer [27]. Four alu-\\nminum electrodes are aligned and evaporated on top of\\nthe two nanostrings, forming one half of the vacuum gap\\ncapacitors that are coupled to three microwave resonators\\nand one DC voltage bias line as shown schematically in\\nFig. 1c (see App. A for details).\\nThe voltage bias line can be used to generate an attrac-\\ntive force which pulls the nanobeam and tunes the oper-\\nating point frequencies of the device [9]. Fig. 1 d shows\\nthe measured resonance frequency change as a function\\nof the applied bias voltage Vdc. As expected, resonators\\n1 and 3 are tuned to higher frequency due to an increased\\nvacuum gap while resonator 2 is tuned to lower frequency.\\nA large tunable bandwidth of up to 30 MHz as obtained\\nfor resonator 2, the ability to excite the motion directly\\nand to modulate the electromechanical coupling in-situ\\nrepresents an important step towards new optomechani-\\ncal experiments and more practicable on-chip reciprocal\\nand nonreciprocal devices.\\nAs a ﬁrst step we carefully calibrate and character-\\nize the individual electromechanical couplings and noise\\nproperties. We then measure the bidirectional frequency\\nconversion between two microwave resonator modes as\\nmediated by one mechanical mode [10]. The incoming\\nsignal photons can also be distributed to two ports with\\nvarying probability as a function of the parametric drive\\nstrength and in direct analogy to a tunable beam split-\\nter.\\nWe present the experimental results, the relevant\\nsample parameters and the theoretical analysis of this\\nbidirectional frequency conversion process in App. B.\\nDirectionality is achieved by engaging the second me-\\nchanical mode, a method which was developed in paral-\\nlel to this work [28, 29] for demonstrating nonreciproc-\\narXiv:1706.00376v2  [quant-ph]  6 Jun 2017\\n2\\nResonator 1\\nNanostring\\nPort 1\\nPort 2\\nVdc (V)\\n- 4\\n- 2\\n0\\n 2\\n4\\n11.38\\n11.37\\n9.58\\n9.59\\n9.60\\n9.77\\n9.78\\n9.79\\n9.80\\nFrequency (GHz)\\nCs,1\\nCm,1\\nCm,3\\nCm,2\\nCm\\nL1\\nCs,3\\nL3\\nCs,2\\nL2\\na1,in\\na2,out\\nport 1\\na3,in\\na3,out\\nport 2\\na2,in\\na2,out\\nVdc\\nmode 2\\nmode 1\\na\\nd\\nc\\nb\\nVdc\\n10 ¹m\\n100 ¹m\\nResonator 3\\nResonator 2\\nResonator 1\\nResonator 2\\nResonator 3\\nFIG. 1.\\nMicrochip circulator and tunability. a, Scan-\\nning electron micrograph of the electromechanical device in-\\ncluding three microwave resonators, two physical ports, one\\nvoltage bias input (Vdc) and an inset of the spiral inductor\\ncross-overs (green dashed boxed area). b, Enlarged view of\\nthe silicon nanostring mechanical oscillator with four vacuum-\\ngap capacitors coupled to the three inductors and one voltage\\nbias.

We begin\\nwith the theoretical model describing two microwave cav-\\nities with resonance frequencies ωi and total linewidths\\nκi with i = 1, 2 parametrically coupled to two distinct\\nmodes of a mechanical resonator with resonance frequen-\\ncies ωm,j and damping rates γm,j with j = 1, 2. To es-\\ntablish the parametric coupling, we apply four microwave\\ntones, with frequencies detuned by δj from the lower mo-\\ntional sidebands of the resonances, as shown in Fig. 2a.\\nIn a reference frame rotating at the frequencies ωi and\\nωm,j +δj, the linearized Hamiltonian in the resolved side-\\nband regime (ωm,j ≫κ1, κ2) is given by (¯h = 1)\\nH = −\\nX\\nj=1,2\\nδjb†\\njbj +\\nX\\ni,j=1,2\\nGij\\n\\x10\\neiφijaib†\\nj + e−iφija†\\nibj\\n\\x11\\n+Hoﬀ,\\n(1)\\nwhere ai (bj) is the annihilation operator for the cavity\\ni (mechanics j), Gij = g0,ij√nij and g0ij are the ef-\\nfective and vacuum electromechanical coupling rates be-\\ntween the mechanical mode j and cavity i respectively,\\nwhile nij is the total number of photons inside the cavity\\ni due to the drive with detuning ∆ij, and φij is the rel-\\native phase set by drives. Here, ∆11 = ∆21 = ωm,1 + δ1\\nand ∆22 = ∆12 = ωm,2 + δ2 are the detunings of the\\ndrive tones with respect to the cavities and Hoﬀde-\\nscribes the time dependent coupling of the mechanical\\nmodes to the cavity ﬁelds due to the oﬀ-resonant drive\\ntones.\\nThese additional coupling terms create cross-\\ndamping [30] and renormalize the mechanical modes, and\\ncan only be neglected in the weak coupling regime for\\nGij, κj ≪ωj, |ωm,2 −ωm,1|.\\nTo see how the nonreciprocity arises we use the quan-\\ntum Langevin equations of motion along with the input-\\noutput theorem to express the scattering matrix Sij of\\nthe system described by the Hamiltonian (1), and relat-\\ning the input photons ain,i(ωi) at port i to the output\\nphotons aout,j(ωj) at port j via aout,i = P\\nj=1,2 Sijain,i\\nwith i = 1, 2.\\nThe dynamics of the four-mode sys-\\ntem described by Hamiltonian (1) is fully captured by\\na set of linear equations of motion as veriﬁed in App. C.\\nSolving these equations in the frequency domain, us-\\ning the input-output relations, and setting φ22 = φ,\\nφ11 = φ21 = φ12 = 0, the ratio of backward to forward\\ntransmission reads\\nλ := S12(ω)\\nS21(ω) =\\n√C11C21Σm,2(ω) + √C12C22Σm,1(ω)eiφ\\n√C11C21Σm,2(ω) + √C12C22Σm,1(ω)e−iφ .\\n(2)\\nHere, Σm,j = 1 + 2i\\n\\x02\\n(−1)jδ −ω\\n\\x03\\n/γm,j is the inverse of\\nthe mechanical susceptibility divided by the mechanical\\nlinewidth γm,j and Cij = 4G2\\nij/(κiγm,j) is the optome-\\nchanical cooperativity. Note that, in Eq. (2) we assume\\nthe device satisﬁes the impedance matching condition on\\nresonance i.e. Sii(ω = 0) = 0 which can be achieved in\\nthe high cooperativity limit (Cij ≫1).\\nInspection of equation (2) reveals the crucial role of\\nthe relative phase between the drive tones φ and the de-\\ntuning δ to obtain nonreciprocal transmission. When the\\ncooperativities for all four optomechanical couplings are\\nequal (Cij = C) then perfect isolation, i.e. λ = 0, occurs\\nfor\\ntan[φ(ω)] = δ(γm,1 + γm,2) + ω(γm,2 −γm,1)\\nγm,1γm,2/2 −2(δ2 −ω2)\\n.\\n(3)\\nEquation 3 shows that on resonance (ω = 0) tan[φ] ∝δ,\\nhighlighting the importance of the detuning δ to obtain\\nnonreciprocity.

The solid lines show the\\nresults of the coupled-mode theory model discussed in the\\ntext. c, Experimental data (top) and theoretical model (bot-\\ntom) of measured transmission coeﬃcients |S12|2 and |S21|2 as\\na function of signal detuning and pump phase φ. Dashed-lines\\nindicate the line plot locations of panel b.\\nwhere η1(2) = κext,1(2)/κ1(2) is the resonator coupling ra-\\ntio and κi = κint,i + κext,i is the total damping rate.\\nHere κint,i denotes the internal loss rate and κext,i the\\nloss rate due to the cavity to waveguide coupling. Equa-\\ntion (4) shows that the maximum of the transmission in\\nforward direction, |S21|2 = η1η2[1−(2C)−1], occurs when\\n2C = 1 + 4δ2/γ2 and for large cooperativities C ≫1.\\nThese conditions, as implemented in our experiment, en-\\nable the observation of asymmetric frequency conversion\\nwith strong isolation in the backward direction and small\\ninsertion loss in forward direction.\\nUsing the on-chip electromechanical microwave circuit\\nshown in Fig. 1 a, we experimentally realize directional\\nwavelength conversion between two superconducting coil\\nresonators at (ω1, ω2)/2π = (9.55, 9.82) GHz coupled to\\ntwo diﬀerent physical waveguide ports and measurement\\nlines with (η1, η2) = (0.74, 0.86). Here, we use the two\\nlowest-frequency vibrational in-plane modes of the me-\\nchanical resonator at (ωm,1, ωm,2)/2π = (4.34, 5.64) MHz\\nwith intrinsic damping rates (γm,1, γm,2)/2π = (4, 8) Hz.\\nThe vacuum optomechanical coupling strengths for these\\nmode combinations are (g0,11, g0,12, g0,21, g0,22)/2π\\n=\\n(33, 34, 13, 31) Hz.\\nFigure 2 b shows the measured transmission of the\\nwavelength conversion in the forward |S21|2 and back-\\nward directions |S12|2 as a function of probe detuning\\nfor two diﬀerent phases as set by one out of the four\\nphase locked microwave drives. At φ = −102.6 degree\\nand over a frequency range of 1.5 kHz we measure high\\ntransmission from cavity 1 to 2 with an insertion loss of\\n2.4 dB while in the backward direction the transmission\\nis suppressed by up to 40.4 dB. Likewise, at the positive\\nphase of φ = 102.6 degree the transmission from cavity 1\\nto 2 is suppressed while the transmission from cavity 2 to\\n1 is high. In both cases we observe excellent agreement\\nwith theory (solid lines). Fig. 2 c shows the S parameters\\nfor the whole range of phases φ, which are symmetric and\\nbidirectional around φ = 0. We ﬁnd excellent agreement\\nwith theory over the full range of measured phases with\\nless than 10% deviation to independently calibrated drive\\nphoton numbers and without any other free parameters.\\nFor bidirectional wavelength conversion, higher coop-\\nerativity enhances the bandwidth. In contrast, the band-\\nwidth of the nonreciprocal conversion is independent of\\ncooperativity and set only by the intrinsic mechanical\\nlinewidths γm,i, which can be seen in Eq (2). This high-\\nlights the fact that the isolation appears when the en-\\ntire signal energy is dissipated in the mechanical environ-\\nment, a lossy bath that can be engineered eﬀectively [7].\\nIn the present case it is the oﬀ-resonant coupling be-\\ntween the resonators and the mechanical oscillator which\\nmodiﬁes this bath. The applied drives create an eﬀec-\\ntive interaction between the mechanical modes, where\\none mode acts as a reservoir for the other and vice versa.\\nThis changes both the damping rates and the eigenfre-\\nquencies of the mechanical modes. It therefore increases\\nthe instantaneous bandwidth of the conversion and auto-\\nmatically introduces the needed detuning, which is fully\\ntaken into account in the theory.\\nThe described two-port isolator can be extended to an\\neﬀective three-port device by parametrically coupling the\\nthird microwave resonator capacitively to the dielectric\\nnanostring, as shown in Fig. 1 a. The third resonator at\\na resonance frequency of ω3/2π = 11.30 GHz is coupled\\nto the waveguide with η3 = 0.52 and to the two in-plane\\nmechanical modes with (g0,31, g0,32)/2π = (22, 45) Hz.\\nSimilar to the isolator, we establish a parametric cou-\\n4\\n1.9 dB cavity loss\\n3.4 dB cavity loss\\n4.1 dB cavity loss\\n3.8 dB insertion loss\\n3.8 dB insertion loss\\n4.4 dB insertion loss\\n3\\n3\\na\\nb\\nc\\nTransmission (dB)\\n-40\\n-30\\n-20\\n-10\\n0\\nPump phase (deg)\\n-180\\n-90\\n0\\n90\\n180\\n-180\\n-90\\n0\\n90\\n180\\nProbe detuning (Hz)\\n-700 -350\\n350 700\\n0\\n-700 -350\\n350 700\\n0\\n-700 -350\\n350 700\\n0\\nData\\nData\\nData\\nTheory\\nTheory\\nTheory\\njS12j2\\njS23j2\\njS31j2\\njS12j2\\njS23j2\\njS31j2\\nPhase = -54\\nPhase = -54\\nPhase = -54\\nC3\\nC2\\nC1\\nC3\\nC2\\nC1\\nC3\\nC2\\nC1\\njS12j2\\njS23j2\\njS32j2\\njS13j2\\njS31j2\\njS21j2\\nC1\\nM2\\nM1\\nC2\\nG11\\nG21\\nG22\\nG12\\nG31\\nG32\\na1,in\\na1,out\\na3,in\\na3,out\\nC2\\na2,in\\na2,out\\n0\\n-20\\n-40\\ndB\\nFIG. 3.

Using\\nan extra microwave source as probe signal, we measure\\nthe power transmission between all ports and directions\\nas shown in Fig. 3 b for a single ﬁxed phase of φ = −54\\ndegree, optimized experimentally for forward circulation.\\nAt this phase we see high transmission in the for-\\nward direction S21,32,13 with an insertion loss of (3.8,\\n3.8, 4.4) dB and an isolation in the backward direction\\nS12,23,31 of up to (18.5, 23, 23) dB.

The nanostring resonator fabricated\\nfrom a high resistivity smart-cut silicon-on-insulator wafer with 220 nm device layer thickness has a length of 9.4 µm\\nand consists of two metalized beams that are connected with two tethers at their ends. The vacuum gap size for the\\nmechanically compliant capacitor fabricated with an inverse shadow technique [31] is approximately 60 nm.\\nThe electromechanical coupling between the nanostring mechanical resonator and each LC circuit is given by\\ng0i = xzpf\\n∂ωi\\n∂v = −xzpfζi\\nωi\\n2Cm,i\\n∂Cm,i\\n∂v\\n,\\n(A1)\\nwhere v is the amplitude coordinate of the in-plane mode, ζi = Cm,i\\nCΣ,i is the participation ratio of the vacuum gap\\ncapacitance Cm,i to the total capacitance of the circuit CΣ,i = Cm,i + Cs,i, where Cs,i is the stray capacitance of the\\ncircuit including the intrinsic self-capacitance of the inductor coils. Eq. (A1) indicates that large electromechanical\\ncoupling g0i requires a large participation ratio. We can make the coil capacitance CL,i relatively small by using a\\nsuspended and tightly wound rectangular spiral inductor with a wire width of 500 nm and wire-to-wire pitch of 1µm\\n[32]. Knowing the inductances Li of the fabricated inductors based on modiﬁed Wheeler, as well as the actually\\nmeasured resonance frequencies ωi along with vacuum-gap capacitance Cm (from FEM simulations), we can ﬁnd\\nthe total stray capacitance including the intrinsic self-capacitance of the each inductor coil correspondingly.

The electromechanical coupling is driven by two strong drive ﬁelds, E1 and E2, near the\\nred sideband of the respective microwave modes at ωd,1(2) = ω1(2) −ωm, see Fig. 4 b.\\nIn the resolved-sideband\\nlimit (ωm ≫κ1(2), γ) the linearized electromechanical Hamiltonian in the rotating frames with respect to the external\\ndriving ﬁelds is given by (¯h = 1)\\nH =\\nX\\ni=1,2\\n∆ia†\\niai + ωmb†b +\\nX\\ni=1,2\\nGi\\n\\x10\\naib† + ba†\\ni\\n\\x11\\n,\\n(B1)\\nwhere a1(2) is the annihilation operator for the microwave signal ﬁeld 1 (microwave signal ﬁeld 2), b is the annihilation\\noperator of the mechanical mode, ∆1(2) = ω1(2) −ωd1(2) = ωm is the detuning between the external driving ﬁeld\\nand the relevant cavity resonance, and Gi = g0i√ni is the eﬀective electromechanical coupling rate between the\\n8\\nC1\\nM1\\nC2\\na\\nb\\nc\\nG1\\na1,in\\na1,out\\na2,in\\na2,out\\nG2\\nPSD\\n!m\\n!m\\n!m\\n!d,1\\n!d,2\\n!\\nS12 » S21\\nC2\\nC1 = 95\\njS11j2\\njS22j2\\njTj2\\n1.0\\n0.8\\n0.6\\n0.4\\n0.2\\n0.0\\n0\\n100\\n150\\n50\\n200\\n250\\n300\\nBeam Splitter\\nCavity \\nLoss\\n-140\\n0.5 1\\n102 104\\n106\\n0.1\\n0.3\\n0.5\\n0.7\\n-120\\nPSignal (dBm) \\nnSignal \\n-100 -80\\njTj2\\nFIG. 4. Bidirectional frequency conversion. a, The microwave-mechanical mode diagram for the frequency conversion.\\nTwo microwave cavities C1 and C2 are parametrically coupled to a mechanical mode with coupling rates G1 and G2, which\\ngives rise to frequency conversion between the two microwave cavities. b, Power spectral densities (PSD) of the mechanical\\nmode and microwave cavities and the drive tone frequencies indicated with vertical arrows near the red sidebands of the\\nmicrowave modes at ωd,1(2) = ω1(2) −ωm. c, Experimental demonstration (dots) and theoretical prediction (solid lines) of the\\nfrequency conversion between two microwave cavities at resonance frequencies (ω1, ω2)/2π = (9.55, 9.82) GHz as a function of\\ncooperativity C2 for C1 = 95. Here, |T|2 = |S12| · |S21| (yellow dots), |S11|2 (red dots) and |S22|2 (blue dots) demonstrate the\\nmagnitude of the transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients on resonance with the cavities, respectively. As predicted by Eq. (B2),\\nthe transmission between the two cavities is maximum for C1 = C2 ≈95. The inset shows the dynamic range of the device\\nwhere the transmission coeﬃcient is measured as function of the signal input power Psignal or mean total number of signal\\nphotons inside the microwave cavities nsignal.\\nmechanical resonator and cavity i with ni =\\n2Ei\\nκ2\\ni +4∆2\\ni being the total number of photons inside the cavity.\\nNote\\nthat, the fast-oscillating counter-rotating terms at ±2ωm are omitted from the Hamiltonian under the rotating wave\\napproximation.\\nThe ﬁrst and second terms of Hamiltonian (B1) describe the free energy of the mechanical and cavity modes while\\nthe last term of the Hamiltonian indicates a beam splitter-like interaction between mechanical degree of freedom\\nand microwave cavity modes. In fact this term allows both optomechanical cooling (with rate Γi = 4G2\\ni /κi) and\\nbidirectional photon conversion between two distinct microwave frequencies. In the photon conversion process, ﬁrst\\nan input microwave signal at frequency ω1 with amplitude ain,1(ω1) is down-converted into the mechanical mode at\\nfrequency ωm, i.e. a1(ω1)\\nH∝a1b†\\n−−−−−→b(ωm). Next, during an up-conversion process the mechanical mode transfers its\\nenergy to the output of the other microwave cavity at frequency ω2 and amplitude aout,2(ω2), i.e. b(ωm)\\nH∝ba†\\n2\\n−−−−→a2(ω2).\\nLikewise, an input microwave signal at frequency ω2 can be converted to frequency ω1 by reversing the conversion\\nprocess. In fact, the Hermitian aspect of the Hamiltonian (B1) makes the conversion process bidirectional and holds\\nthe time-reversal symmetry.\\nThe photon conversion eﬃciency, which is deﬁned as the ratio of the output-signal photon ﬂux over the input-signal\\nphoton ﬂux, is given by |S21|2 =\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\naout,2(ω2)\\nain,1(ω1)\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\n2\\n. Since the conversion process is bidirectional therefore |S21| = |S12| = |T|.\\nIn the steady state and in the weak coupling regime the conversion eﬃciency reduces to\\n|T|2 =\\n4η1η2C1C2\\n(1 + C1 + C2)2 ,\\n(B2)\\n9\\nwhere C1(2) =\\n4g2\\n0,1(2)n1(2)\\nκ1(2)γm\\nis the electromechanical cooperativity for cavity 1 (2) and η1(2) =\\nκext,1(2)\\nκ1(2)\\nis the output\\ncoupling ratio in which κi = κint,i + κext,i is the total damping rate while κint,i and κext,i show the intrinsic and\\nextrinsic decay rate of the microwave cavities, respectively. Likewise, the reﬂection coeﬃcients due to impedance\\nmismatch are given by\\n|S11|2 =\\n\\x101 + C1 + C2 −2η1(1 + C2)\\n1 + C1 + C2\\n\\x112\\n,\\n(B3)\\n|S22|2 =\\n\\x101 + C1 + C2 −2η2(1 + C1)\\n1 + C1 + C2\\n\\x112\\n.\\n(B4)\\nNote that for the lossless microwave cavities (ηi = 1), near unity photon conversion can be achieved in the limit\\nthat C1 = C2 = C and C ≫1. The former condition balances the photon-phonon conversion rate for each cavity\\nwhile the later condition guarantees the mechanical damping rate γm is much weaker than the damping rates Γi =\\nγmCi. Under these two conditions, the ideal photon conversion is achieved i.e. |T|2 = 1 (perfect transmission) and\\n|S11|2 = |S22|2 = 0 (no reﬂection). The denominator of Eq. (B2) indicates that the bandwidth of the conversion is\\ngiven by ΓT = γm + Γ1 + Γ2, which is the total back-action-damped linewidth of the mechanical resonator in the\\npresence of the two microwave drive ﬁelds.\\nWe perform coherent microwave frequency conversion using the intermediate nanostring resonator as a coupling\\nelement between two superconducting coil resonators at ω1/2π = 9.55 GHz and ω2/2π = 9.82 GHz as shown in\\nFig 1 a. The microwave cavities are accessible by ports”, i.e. semi-inﬁnite transmission lines giving the modes ﬁnite\\nenergy decay rates leading to the cavity linewidths κ1/2π = 2.42 MHz and κ2/2π = 1.98 MHz with associated\\noutput coupling ratios η1 = 0.74 and η2 = 0.86, indicating that both cavities are strongly overcoupled to the two\\ndistinct physical ports 1 and 2. The fundamental mode of the mechanical oscillator has a resonance frequency of\\nωm/2π = 4.34MHz with the corresponding damping rate of γm/2π = 4Hz. Measuring the mechanical resonator noise\\nspectrum along with the oﬀ-resonant reﬂection coeﬃcients of each cavity and measurement line, we calibrate the gain\\nand attenuation in each input-output line and accurately back out the vacuum optomechanical coupling rate for each\\ncavity of g01/2π = 33Hz and g02/2π = 13Hz.\\nFigure 4 c shows the measured scattering parameters |S11|2 (red line), |S22|2 (blue line), and |T|2 = |S12| · |S21|\\n(yellow line) versus the electromechanical cooperativity C2 at C1 = 95. As predicted by Eq. (B2) at C1 = C2 ≃95\\nwe measure a transmission of |T|2 = 0.64, which is dominated by internal losses of the cavities limiting the maximum\\nreachable conversion eﬃciency to |T|2 ≤η1η2 = 0.64.\\nAnother important aspect of such a transducer is the dynamic range of the device. In the inset of Fig. 4 c we\\nshow measured maximum transmission as a function of the applied signal power. Our results demonstrate that high\\nconversion eﬃciencies can be maintained up to about −80 dBm input signal power, corresponding to about 105 signal\\nphotons inside the cavities. At even higher signal powers the transmission eﬃciency is degraded abruptly, because\\nthe probe tone acts as an additional strong drive invalidating the transducer model, and also because of an increase\\nof the resonance frequency shifts and resonator losses.\\nAppendix C: General theory of a coupled electromechanical system\\n1.\\nHamiltonian of a multi-mode electromechanical transducer\\nIn this section we present a general theory to describe the nonreciprocal behavior of our on-chip electromechanical\\ntransducer, shown in Fig 1a of the main paper. We begin with an optomechanical system comprised of three microwave\\ncavities with frequencies ωi and linewidths κi where i = 1, 2, 3 that are coupled to two vibrational modes of a\\nmechanical oscillator with frequencies ωm.i and damping rates γm,i where i = 1, 2. To tune a desired coupling into\\nresonance, we assume the cavities are coherently driven with six microwave tones, with frequencies detuned from the\\nlower motional sidebands of the resonances by δ0,i. The Hamiltonian of the system is (¯h = 1)[34]\\nH =\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\nωia†\\niai +\\n2\\nX\\ni=1\\nωm,ib†\\nibi +\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\n2\\nX\\nj=1\\ng0,ija†\\niai(bj + b†\\nj) + Hd,\\n(C1)\\nwhere ai is the annihilation operator for the cavity i, bj is the annihilation operator of the mechanical mode j, and\\nHd =\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\n2\\nX\\nj=1\\nEij(aiei(ωd,ijt+φij) + a†\\nie−i(ωd,ijt+φij)),\\n(C2)\\n10\\ndescribes the Hamiltonian of the pumps with amplitude Eij = E∗\\nij, frequency ωd,ij, and phase φij.\\nWe can linearize Hamiltonian (C1) by expanding the cavity modes around their steady-state ﬁeld amplitudes,\\nai →ai −P2\\nj=1 αije−iωd,ijt, where |αij|2 = 4|Eije−iφij|2/(κ2\\ni + 4∆2\\nij) is the mean number of photons inside the cavity\\ni induced by the microwave pump due to driving mechanical mode j, the κi = κint,i + κext,i is the total damping rate\\nof the cavity while κint,i and κext,i show the intrinsic and extrinsic decay rate of the microwave cavities, respectively.\\nHere, ∆ij = ωi −ωd,ij is the detuning of the drive tone with respect to cavity i. In the rotating frame with respect\\nto P3\\ni=1 ωia†\\niai + P2\\ni=1(ωm,i + δ0,i)b†\\nibi, the linearized Hamiltonian becomes\\nH = −\\n2\\nX\\ni=1\\nδ0,ib†\\nibi +\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\nn\\x10\\n2\\nX\\nj=1\\n\\x02\\nαijei∆ijta†\\ni + α∗\\nije−i∆ijtai\\n\\x03\\x11\\x10\\n2\\nX\\nj=1\\ng0,ij\\n\\x02\\nbje−i(ωm,j+δ0,j)t + b†\\njei(ωm,j+δ0,j)t\\x03\\x11o\\n.\\n(C3)\\nBy setting the eﬀective cavity detunings so that ∆11 = ∆21 = ∆31 = ωm,1 + δ0,1 and ∆12 = ∆22 = ∆32 = ωm,2 + δ0,2\\nand neglecting the terms rotating at ±2ωm,1(2) and ωm,1 + ωm,2, the above Hamiltonian reduces to\\nH = −\\n2\\nX\\ni=1\\nδ0,ib†\\nibi +\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\n2\\nX\\nj=1\\n\\x10\\nGija†\\nibj + G∗\\nijaib†\\nj\\n\\x11\\n+ Hoﬀ.\\n(C4)\\nwhere Gij = g0,ij|αij|e−iφij is the eﬀective coupling rate between the mechanical mode j and cavity i and Hoﬀ\\ndescribes oﬀ-resonant/time dependent interaction between mechanical modes and the cavity ﬁelds, and it is given by\\nHoﬀ=\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\n2\\nX\\nj=1\\nh\\nFija†\\nibje(−1)j−1iδωmt + H.c.\\ni\\n(C5)\\nwhere δωm = ωm,2 −ωm,1 + δ0,2 −δ0,1 and we deﬁne following oﬀ-resonant optomechanical coupling parameters\\nF11 = g0,11|α12|e−iφ12, F12 = g0,12|α11|e−iφ11,\\nF21 = g0,21|α22|e−iφ22, F22 = g0,22|α21|e−iφ21,\\n(C6)\\nF31 = g0,31|α32|e−iφ32, F32 = g0,32|α31|e−iφ31.\\nThe oﬀ-resonant Hamiltonian (C5) has an essential role in the nonreciprocity aspect of our device, therefore, it\\nis important to discuss the physical roots of such oﬀ-resonant couplings [30, 35]. Inspection of Hamiltonians (C4)\\nand (C5) reveals that each drive tone generates two diﬀerent types of interactions: Resonant coupling in which the\\ndrive tone couples a single mechanical mode to a single cavity mode, described by the time-independent part of the\\nHamiltonian (C4). Each drive tone also generates an interaction which couples the other mechanical mode to the\\ncavity oﬀ-resonantly. The Hamiltonians (C5) explain this oﬀ-resonant coupling between cavity ﬁelds and mechanical\\nmodes. As we will see, these oﬀ-resonant couplings alter the mechanical damping rate, which changes the isolation\\nbandwidth and also cools the mechanical modes. In addition, the coupling also introduces mechanical frequency shifts\\nand introduces an eﬀective detuning for the drive tones. Note that, within the rotating wave approximation (RWA)\\nthe non-resonant/time-dependent components of the eﬀective linearized interactions can be neglected in the weak\\ncoupling regime and when the cavity decay rates κi are much smaller than the two mechanical frequencies ωm,i and\\ntheir diﬀerence\\n|Fij|, κi ≪ωm,j, |ωm,2 −ωm,1|.\\n(C7)\\nFinally, we note that for the isolator case we deal with two cavities coupled two mechanical modes, which mathemat-\\nically is equivalent to set G31 = G32 = F31 = F32 = 0 in our general model. In this special case, the Hamiltonian (C4)\\nreduces to the Hamiltonian (1) presented in the paper\\nH = −\\n2\\nX\\ni=1\\nδ0,ib†\\nibi +\\n2\\nX\\ni,j=1\\n\\x10\\nGija†\\nibj + G∗\\nijaib†\\nj\\n\\x11\\n+ Hoﬀ.\\n(C8)\\nwith\\nHoﬀ=\\n2\\nX\\ni,j=1\\nh\\nFija†\\nibje(−1)j−1iδωmt + H.c.\\ni\\n.\\n(C9)\\n11\\n2.\\nEquations of motion and eﬀective model\\nThe full quantum treatment of the system can be given in terms of the quantum Langevin equations where we add\\nto the Heisenberg equations the quantum noise acting on the mechanical resonators bin,i with damping rates γi as\\nwell as the cavities input ﬂuctuations ain,i with damping rates κext,i.

We\\nuse an iterative method to solve these equations by deﬁning a new set of auxiliary operators (toy modes) and cutting\\nthe iteration sequence at higher order dependence to O(n δωm; δωn\\nm) with n ≥2, which yields\\n˙ai = −κi\\n2 ai −i\\n2\\nX\\nj=1\\nGijbj −i\\n2\\nX\\nj=1\\nFijBj + √κext,iain,i,\\n˙b1 =\\n\\x10\\niδ0,1 −γm,1\\n2\\n\\x11\\nb1 −i\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\nG∗\\ni1ai −i\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\nF ∗\\ni1A−\\ni + √γm,1bin,1,\\n˙b2 =\\n\\x10\\niδ0,2 −γm,2\\n2\\n\\x11\\nb2 −i\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\nG∗\\ni2ai −i\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\nF ∗\\ni2A+\\ni + √γm,2bin,2,\\n(C11)\\n˙A+\\ni = (iδωm −κi\\n2 )A+\\ni −i\\n\\x10\\nFi2b2 + Gi1B1\\n\\x11\\n,\\n˙A−\\ni = −(iδωm + κi\\n2 )A−\\ni −i\\n\\x10\\nFi1b1 + Gi2B2\\n\\x11\\n,\\n˙B1 =\\n\\x10\\ni[δωm + δ0,1] −γm,1\\n2\\n\\x11\\nB1 −i\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\n\\x10\\nF ∗\\ni1ai + G∗\\ni1A+\\ni\\n\\x11\\n,\\n˙B2 = −\\n\\x10\\ni[δωm −δ0,2] + γm,2\\n2\\n\\x11\\nB2 −i\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\n\\x10\\nF ∗\\ni2ai + G∗\\ni2A−\\ni\\n\\x11\\n,\\nwhere i = 1, 2, 3. The auxiliary modes A±\\ni = aie±iδωmt, B1 = b1eiδωmt and B2 = b2e−iδωmt describe the oﬀ-resonant\\ncomponents of the equations of motion. Here, we take δωm to be much larger than the relevant system frequencies, i.e.\\nδωm ≫γm,i, δ0,i, ω, and can thus adiabatically eliminate the auxiliary modes by taking ˙Bj = ˙A±\\ni = 0 in Eqs.

In this case the oﬀ-resonant interactions between the mechanical modes and cavities are\\n12\\nnegligible and we can safely ignore the time-dependent components of the Hamiltonian (i.e. Hoﬀ= 0). However, in\\nour system due to ﬁnite value of δωm ≈κi/2, we cannot ignore these oﬀ-resonant interactions.\\nWe can simply further the equations of motion for the main modes by substituting Eqs. (C12) into the equations\\nof motion for ai and bj in Eqs. (C11) and assuming δωm, κi ≫\\nn\\n|δ0,j|, γm,j, |Gij|, |Fij|\\no\\n,\\n˙ai ≈−κi\\n2 ai −i\\n2\\nX\\nj=1\\nGijbj + √κext,iain,i,\\n˙b1 ≈\\n\\x10\\niδ1 −Γm,1\\n2\\n\\x11\\nb1 −i\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\nG∗\\ni1ai + √γm,1bin,1,\\n(C13)\\n˙b2 ≈\\n\\x10\\niδ2 −Γm,2\\n2\\n\\x11\\nb2 −i\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\nG∗\\ni2ai + √γm,2bin,2,\\nwhere δj and Γm,j are the eﬀective detuning and damping rates of the mechanical modes, respectively, and they are\\ngiven by\\nδ1 = δ0,1 + δωm\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\n4|Fi1|2\\n4δω2m + κ2\\ni\\n,\\nδ2 = δ0,2 −δωm\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\n4|Fi2|2\\n4δω2m + κ2\\ni\\n,\\n(C14)\\nΓm,1 = γm,1 +\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\n4κi|Fi1|2\\n4δω2m + κ2\\ni\\n,\\nΓm,2 = γm,2 +\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\n4κi|Fi2|2\\n4δω2m + κ2\\ni\\n.\\nNote that in the derivation of Eqs. (C13) we assume that the oﬀ-resonant interaction does not considerably modify the\\nself-interaction and damping rate of the cavity modes. Inspection of Eqs. (C13) reveals that the oﬀ-resonant coupling\\nbetween mechanical modes and cavities shifts the resonance frequency and damps/cools the mechanical modes by\\nintroducing a cross-damping between them. The strength of the frequency shift and the cross-damping is given by\\nthe oﬀ-resonant optomechanical coupling parameters Fij, which indicates that the drive tones creates an eﬀective\\ncoupling between the two mechanical modes. In the weak coupling regime and for very large δωm this cross-coupling\\nis negligible, thus δj ≈δ0,j and Γm,j ≈γm,j.\\nWe can solve the Eqs. (C13) in the Fourier domain to obtain the microwave cavities’ variables.

Here, we are only interested in\\nthe response an electromechanical system comprised of two microwave cavities and two mechanical modes. Therefore,\\nby setting G3j →0 and δ1 = −δ2 = δ in Eq. (C16) and assuming φ22 = φ, φ11 = φ12 = φ21 = 0, we can ﬁnd the ratio\\nof backward to forward transmission\\nλ := S12(ω)\\nS21(ω) =\\n√C11C21Σm,2(ω) + √C12C22Σm,1(ω)eiφ\\n√C11C21Σm,2(ω) + √C12C22Σm,1(ω)e−iφ ,\\n(C17)\\nas speciﬁed in Eq.

(C17) shows that the nominator and\\ndenominator of this equation are not equal and they possess diﬀerent relative phase. This asymmetry is the main\\nsource of the nonreciprocity and appearance of isolation in the system. In particular, at a phase\\neiφ = −\\nr\\nC11C21\\nC12C22\\nΣm,2(ω)\\nΣm,1(ω),\\n(C18)\\nthe nominator of the Eq. (C17) will be zero, therefore, backward transmission S12 is canceled while forward trans-\\nmission S21 is non-zero. Rewriting Eq. (C18) gives\\ntan[φ(ω)] = δ(Γm,1 + Γm,2) + ω(Γm,2 −Γm,1)\\nΓm,1Γm,2/2 −2(δ2 −ω2)\\n.\\n(C19)\\nBy neglecting the contribution of the oﬀ-resonant term in the response of the system, i.e. Γm,j →γm,j the Eq. (C19)\\nreduces to Eq. (3) of the paper. At the optimum phase (C18) and at cavity resonance, the transmission in the forward\\ndirection is given by\\nS21 = −\\n2√η1η2\\n\\x02\\nΣm,1(0)Σm,2(0)\\n\\x03\\x00√C11C21Σm,2(0) + √C12C22Σm,1(0)e−iφ\\x01\\n\\x02\\nC11Σm,2(0) + C12Σm,1(0) + Σm,1(0)Σm,2(0)\\n\\x03\\x02\\nC21Σm,2(0) + C22Σm,1(0) + Σm,1(0)Σm,2(0)\\n\\x03.\\nFor equal mechanical damping Γm,1 = Γm,2 = Γ (equivalent to γm,1 = γm,2 = γ of the main text) and at equal\\ncooperativities for all four optomechanical couplings (Cij = C) the above equation reduces to\\nS21 = −√η1η2\\nh\\n4i δ(1 −2iδ/Γ)\\nCΓ(1 + 1+4δ2/Γ2\\n2C\\n)2\\ni\\n(C20)\\nas speciﬁed in Eq.

We also note that the frequency shifts due to oﬀ-resonant interaction for the isolator system discussed\\nin the main text are given by (δ1, δ2)/2π = (−84, 233) Hz while the cross-damping rates are (Γm,1, Γm,2)/2π =\\n(190, 407) Hz.\\n4.\\nTheoretical model for the circulator\\nThe theoretical model, we presented in Eqs. (C11), or equivalently Eq. (C16), fully describes the nonreciprocal\\nbehavior of the system for the case of the circulator.\\nIn order to check this, in Fig. 5 we show both measured\\nexperimental data and the theoretical prediction.

He is the youngest child of Viswanathan Nair, a former bureaucrat and Law Secretary with the Kerala government, and Santhakumari. He had an elder brother named Pyarelal (died in 2000, due to heart related issues). Director B. Unnikrishnan is a close maternal relative of Mohanlal. Mohanlal was named by his maternal uncle Gopinathan Nair, who initially decided to name him Roshanlal before choosing \"Mohanlal\". However, his father avoided giving him their surname. His father was adamant that he should not bear their caste name (Nair) as surname which they all had. Mohanlal grew up in Mudavanmugal at his paternal home in Thiruvananthapuram. He studied at Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School, Thiruvananthapuram and graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Mahatma Gandhi College, Thiruvananthapuram.
